Webpack Babel Starter
=====================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/topheman/webpack-babel-starter.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/topheman/webpack-babel-starter)
![Release](https://img.shields.io/badge/release-v3-blue.svg)

A **webpack 2** starter kit with full development & build workflow, inspired by [topheman/react-es6-redux](https://github.com/topheman/react-es6-redux).

What's in this boilerplate:

* Development / Build / Lint tasks
* [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) transpiler
* [Eslint](http://eslint.org/) / [babel-eslint](https://github.com/babel/babel-eslint) / [eslint-config-airbnb-base](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-config-airbnb-base)
* Sass support
* Ship a version of your site with sourcemaps (see demo)

Already in use in the following projects:

* [topheman/rxjs-experiments](https://github.com/topheman/rxjs-experiments) (RxJS) *(switched to v2)*
* [topheman/react-es6-redux](https://github.com/topheman/react-es6-redux) (React/Redux/Github Api) - since [v3.0.0](https://github.com/topheman/react-es6-redux/releases/tag/v3.0.0) *(using v1)*
* [topheman/d3-react-experiments](https://github.com/topheman/d3-react-experiments) (React/d3) *(switched to v2 + setup [react-hot-loader@3](https://github.com/topheman/d3-react-experiments/commit/8840b679e9b72310c7bb0a9749cab0a58a568f1f))*

I also have ported it on [topheman/angular2-sandbox](https://github.com/topheman/angular2-sandbox) to be used the same way in an Angular2 / TypeScript project *(using v1)*.

### Install

```shell
git clone https://github.com/topheman/webpack-babel-starter.git
cd webpack-babel-starter
npm install
```

### Run

```shell
npm start
```

Goto [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)

If you need to access from a remote device (such as a smartphone on the same network), just `LOCALHOST=false npm start` and your site will be accessible via your IP (which will be output on the terminal at launch).

### Build

The `./build` directory is ignored by git, it will contain a `dist` directory which holds the distribution version of your website (the one that you will [ship once built](https://github.com/topheman/webpack-babel-starter/wiki#deploy)).

All the build tasks will create a built version of the project in the `./build/dist` folder, cleaning it before making the build.

* `npm run build`
* `npm run build-prod` optimized / uglified version
* `npm run build-prod-all` will build:
	* production version (optimized / uglified)
	* a debuggable version accessible at `/devtools` shipping all the sourcemaps, to ease sharing transpiled source code

`npm run serve-dist` will serve your `./build/dist` folder at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) so that you could test the built version you just made.

### Linter

* eslint is running while you're developping, check your console for errors
* you can also launch it via `npm run lint`
* see `.eslintrc` for the configuration (currently, this project uses [the airbnb presets](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-config-airbnb-base) - if you find it to restrictive, just remove `"extends": "airbnb-base"` in the `.eslintrc`)

### Customizations

You can customize the behavior of the scripts by specifying environments vars:

* `NODE_ENV` by default at `development`, `NODE_ENV=production` when you `npm run build-prod`
* `LINTER=false` will disable the linter (enabled by default, ex: `LINTER=false npm start`)
* `STATS=true` will write `stats.json` profiling file on disk from webpack at build (disabled by default, ex: `STATS=true npm run build`)
* `FAIL_ON_ERROR=true` will break the build if any errors occurs (useful for CIs such as travis - at `false` in dev-server, at `true` when building)
* `LOCALHOST=false` to access via IP from other devices on the same network (ex: `LOCALHOST=false npm start` - default `true`)
* `DEVTOOLS`: By default at `null`. Used internally by `npm run build-prod-all` (you may not need that if you don't do OSS)

### Assets

The main image loaders are declared in the webpack config so that when you `require('./foo.png')` or use the helper `url('./bar.gif')` in your `.scss` files, at build time, those images will automatically be:

* copied into `/build/dist/assets`
* there name will be hashed (without you bothering with the reference in the generated code)
* the hashed name will only change if the file changes (caching & git friendly)
* I made sure that the css supports relative urls (this is why `main.css` lands at the same level as `index.html`)

### FAQ / Deploy

* deploy on github pages - [see wiki](https://github.com/topheman/webpack-babel-starter/wiki#deploy)
* a problem ? Checkout the [FAQ](https://github.com/topheman/webpack-babel-starter/wiki#faq)
* [Using React](https://github.com/topheman/webpack-babel-starter/wiki#react-hot-reload) ? Checkout how I integrated all the usual tools around React on some of my own projects, based on this boilerplate.

### Bonus

Check the source code of the html/js/css generated files, you'll see a banner containing informations such as:

* date the build was made
* version
* git revision / link to this revision on github

### Contributing

PRs are welcome, just keep in mind this boilerplate aims to keep beeing framework agnostic.

Everything related to contributing (tests, framework dependencies ...) is located in the [/contributing](https://github.com/topheman/webpack-babel-starter/tree/master/contributing) folder. Check the readme in there to see how to setup your workspace.

### Versions

#### v3 (current)

* Dropped yarn for npm@5 (you remain free to choose whatever package manager you want, the project is compatible with both yarn and npm).

#### v2

Still available on this [branch](https://github.com/topheman/webpack-babel-starter/tree/v2).

Migrated to [webpack2](https://webpack.js.org/). The workflow and the npm tasks remain exactly the same.

If you were using the v1 with webpack1, the webpack team has [a migrating path](https://webpack.js.org/guides/migrating/). You can also see the steps I followed to migrate this stack from v1 to v2:

* [setup yarn](https://github.com/topheman/webpack-babel-starter/commit/744efcc1b50c323799dec6555832e58d2c80bd6a) (unrelated to webpack)
* [minimal changes for migration to webpack v2](https://github.com/topheman/webpack-babel-starter/commit/848884d7ea85d86b7e5e2a504fe30eeb4aad6568)
* [upgrade eslint](https://github.com/topheman/webpack-babel-starter/commit/fa8d5d3eee6091d9e4dc0e9d97104947e04aa511)
* [code splitting with `import()`](https://github.com/topheman/webpack-babel-starter/commit/41dc1e1ccb540cc6214a93731acb578d86093634)
* [upgrade minor dependencies](https://github.com/topheman/webpack-babel-starter/commit/01d8ec53b49988dd39f88435fa91bd7e0444bce5)

#### v1

Still available on this [branch](https://github.com/topheman/webpack-babel-starter/tree/v1).

First version, using webpack1.
